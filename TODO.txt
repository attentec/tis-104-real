SMALL TASKS

New features:
* Calculate and draw MODE value
* Calculate and draw IDLE value
* Draw an editor cursor (when editing)
* Implement receive and transmit buffers for 'uart'

Cleaning up:
* Let canvas decide the display write order - because it needs it to be Y major
  - possibly by adding a display_set_write_order function and calling it in canvas_init

Nice to have:
* Connect some push buttons for easier debugging and testing
* Fix code paths when running in gdb on PC



MEDIUM TASKS

* Implement a code editor
* Implement display.h for PC using (for example) SDL



LARGE TASKS

* Implement a program parser
* Design and implement a communication protocol
* Run two emulated CPUS on separate AVRs
* Implement breakpoints ("!")
